*first throw of a rest api for my personal website
all i need is a get for getting all notes and a put for adding a new one.*

the rest of the website should be static. the rest service is only needed for the feedback board which is exactly like my old board but newly implemented with all the stuff i learned in the past 8 years!

## install

* cd src
* bundle install
